# odin-recipes
This is my first HTML project. This is a project to build a basic recipe website.

I will have shown competence with all of the beginner level HTML concepts that I have learned through The Odin Project once this is completed.

These 3 paragraphs relating to the introduction were all written before the project was started.

I have learned a lot from the project. I encountered a few troubles, such as the header on the "Roasted Cherry Tomato Soup" recipe not showing correctly, the images not showing at all, and my grammar in the paragraphs below the description not being as good as I would have liked. I looked through other people's submissions and got inspired and got information on what to do better.
